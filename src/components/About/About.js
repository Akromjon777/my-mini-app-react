            Tucked away in the corner of Wellington, Latte Cafe is a local
            neighbourhood cafe and bar. Latte is all about doing what we love,
            in a city that we love. We keep stocked with local produce and
            pastries. Bring your family for a bite, or meet your friends for a
            coffee or warm drink.
